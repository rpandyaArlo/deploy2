# NOTE: We run the installer as the user rather than root to limit its
# actions. For example, if root and the 'jira' user exists then it
# will create 'jira1'; this potentially creates idempotency/upgrade
# issues down the line.
# The variable {{ atl_product_download }} will be on temp for first nodes and shared_home for
# subsequent nodes.
